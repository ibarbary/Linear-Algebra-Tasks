# Linear-Algebra-Tasks
1) Linear System Solver
- Created a python program that solves linear systems of equations of different sizes (e.g., 2x2, 3x3) using the Gauss-Jordan Elimination method
- Added multiple test cases to handle input errors, making it more efficient and robust
- Handled different types of solutions, such as unique solution, infinite solution, and no solution

2) Matix Inverse Finder
- Developed a program that finds the inverse of matrices of diverse sizes, including 1x1, 2x2, and nxn, demonstrating its adaptability and wide range of uses
- Added test cases that addresses potential input errors, enhancing program stability and user experience
- Implemented the Inverse Rule to accurately determine if a matrix has an inverse or not
